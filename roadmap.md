# Roadmap

Maintained by the `po` agent. Order follows the build order in the constitution. An item is `done`
only when every task in its range in `specs/001-crawler-map-mode/tasks.md` is `[X]`.
Status: `todo`, `in progress`, `done`. Last reviewed: 2026-09-24.

| ID | Item | Tasks | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-01 | Workspace scaffold and test/lint tooling | T001–T006 | done |
| R-02 | Fingerprint package: route template, ARIA canonicalization, two-level fingerprint | T007–T011 | done |
| R-03 | Repo restructure: TS workspace moved to `apps/crawler/`; `governor` and `po` agents | — (not in tasks.md) | done |
| R-04 | Core: Zod schemas, migrations, DB access, ids, PII scrubber, evidence store, logging | T012–T021 | done |
| R-05 | Config: portal and persona loaders, `extends`, secret detection | T022–T030 | done |
| R-06 | US2 Production is only read: safety classifier, env guard, gates, rate limiter | T031–T044 | done |
| R-07 | US1 Map a portal as a guest: MCP server, obstacles, crawler runtime, agent, mock-portal run | T045–T065 | in progress |
| R-08 | US3 Portals and personas as reusable configuration | T066 | done |
| R-09 | US4 Hand locators to QA | T067–T069 | done |
| R-10 | Polish and cross-cutting concerns | T070–T074 | in progress |
| R-11 | Portal-agnostic safety: robots.txt enforcement, generic rule ids, per-portal rules | — (spec pending) | in progress |

## Notes

- R-03 is recorded as out-of-spec work (resolved 2026-09-21): repo housekeeping (TS workspace
  moved under `apps/crawler/`, `governor` and `po` agents) that delivers no feature requirement, so
  no task line is added to `tasks.md` (that would renumber T001-T074 references). Path changes it
  caused are already reflected in `tasks.md`. Traceable via commit `b1639fc` and the agents commit
  `348fac0`.
- R-06 is built before R-07 (safety first, Principle V); R-04 and R-05 block both.
- Commits: R-02 `02e17b7`, R-03 `b1639fc` and `348fac0`, R-04 `5633dc4`, R-05 `17f1187`, R-06 `eee48a9`,
  R-07 `dfe3f40` and `23c8a9b` (open), R-08 `412ed19`, R-09 `d4907a4`, R-10 partial `6f1b0d8` (open), deps `59807cb`.
- R-04 branch: `feature/001-r04-core-crawler-map-mode`. R-05 to R-09 and most of R-10 were also built on this
  branch and are now split into one commit per item (see Commits); `po` closes R-07 and R-10 once their open tasks pass.
- Open in R-07: T059 (placeholder obstacle selectors need a supervised live run). Open in R-10: T072 (manual
  compliance gate), T073 (quickstart on the live portal), T074 (live bypass-attempt run).
- R-11 spec folder: `specs/002-portal-agnostic-safety` (spec not yet written). Branch
  `feature/002-r11-portal-agnostic-safety` is stacked on `feature/001-r04-core-crawler-map-mode` (not
  master), because master (`348fac0`) predates all spec-001 code and R-11 builds on it; R-11 must merge
  after R-04's branch (i.e. after R-07/R-10 close on that branch).
- Allegro Lokalnie is on hold for legal reasons (Regulamin Allegro art. 10.10: reuse of Allegro
  materials "wymaga każdorazowo zgody Allegro.pl"). The live-run tasks of R-07/R-10 (T059, T072, T073,
  T074) now target `uniqa` (`portals/uniqa/portal.yaml`, `personas/uniqa/guest.yaml`, committed
  `db05277`) instead of `allegro-lokalnie`. The uniqa live run is blocked on R-11 item (1) — automatic
  robots.txt enforcement, needed to close the `cHash` denylist gap — plus the T072 manual compliance
  sign-off for uniqa.
