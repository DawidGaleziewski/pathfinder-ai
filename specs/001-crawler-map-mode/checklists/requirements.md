# Specification Quality Checklist: Crawler Map Mode (Allegro Lokalnie MVP)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The file paths and YAML formats for portal and persona configs are stated in the spec because
  the user explicitly requested them as part of the feature; they are interface requirements,
  not implementation choices.
- The terms-of-use review of Allegro Lokalnie is a manual precondition to the first production
  run (see Assumptions) and is not something the crawler can verify. Annex 13 was reviewed
  (no automated-access clause); the main Regulamin is still pending.
- Spec updated after the annex review: denylist extended (FR-007), FR-023 to FR-025 added,
  and new edge cases for view-count effects and binding actions.
- Constitution v1.1.0 alignment: Principles I-VII and the production policy are reflected in
  FR-002 to FR-008, FR-014 and FR-017/FR-018.
